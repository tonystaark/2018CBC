            <p>Let me begin by bringing to you my warmest greetings in the most wonderful Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We meet at the beginning of 2018 offering our gratitude to God for His presence, His providence, His provision and His protection throughout the whole of 2017. Into 2018, we are mindful of the changing socio-political-economical and religious landscape of our nation and so the theme for CBC for 2018 is aptly entitled ‘A Year of Bearing Fruit.’</p>
            <br>
            <p>Why a year of bearing fruit? This is because reproduction or bearing fruit ensures that the Church will live past its founding stages. From ‘A Year of Maturing Discipleship and Fruitful Engagements’ in 2017, we must become a reproducing disciple-making church once again. There is no happier time than when a family is getting ready to have a baby. Likewise, CBC group of churches are full of excitement and energy whenever they are reproducing and bearing fruit. The reason is that the Church are fulfilling their God-given purpose for existence. The Church was never intended to be an end in itself; rather it is called to reproduce and bear fruit and fulfill the Great Commission
            to make disciples. Reproduction and bearing fruit is the goal of every living thing. We see this throughout
            the pages of the Bible. The Bible is full of reproductive language.</p>
